# Voice Chatbot: Your AI-Powered Conversational Assistant

Welcome to the Voice Chatbot project! 👋 This cutting-edge application combines the power of voice recognition, natural language processing, and AI to create a seamless, hands-free chatbot experience. Whether you're a developer looking to contribute or a user eager to explore, we're excited to have you on board!

## 🎯 What We're Aiming For

Imagine having a conversation with an AI as naturally as you would with a friend. That's our goal! Voice Chatbot is designed to:

1. Listen to your voice input
2. Transcribe your speech to text
3. Process your query using advanced Rag techniques
4. Generate a thoughtful response
5. Speak the response back to you

All of this happens in real-time, creating a fluid, interactive experience that feels like magic! 🪄

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how to get Voice Chatbot up and running on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/snehpushp/voice_chatbot.git
   cd voice_chatbot
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   - Copy `example.env` to `.env`
   - Fill in your API keys and other required information in `.env`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   poetry run python src/main.py
   ```

## 🛠 How It Works

Voice Chatbot is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to understand and extend:

- `transcription/`: Converts your speech to text
- `rag/`: Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation system processes your query
- `llms/`: Interfaces with language models (currently using Groq)
- `audio/`: Handles text-to-speech conversion (powered by Deepgram)
- `session/`: Manages conversation context and history
- `document_processing/`: Extracts and processes document content for the RAG system

## 🔮 Future Scope

We're just getting started! Here are some exciting features on our roadmap:

1. Web-based UI for easier interaction
2. Support for multiple languages
3. Integration with more AI models and services
4. Custom wake word detection
5. Voice emotion analysis for more nuanced responses

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it! Feel free to open an issue with your feature request.

Our ultimate aim is to build real life Jarvis (that knows everything and who's dedicated to help you)
